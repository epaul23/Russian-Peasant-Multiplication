## Russian Peasant Multiplication (Java)

This project demonstrates the Russian Peasant Multiplication algorithm,
which multiplies two integers using a decrease-by-constant-factor strategy.

This project was created out of curiosity after learning the algorithm in my Algorithm Analysis class. I found the idea behind the algorithm interesting and decided to implement it in Java to better understand how the theory translates into code.

The implementation separates:
- Core algorithm logic
- Step-by-step visualization (table output)

This makes the algorithm easy to understand and suitable for learning purposes.

**Time Complexity:** Θ(log n)
